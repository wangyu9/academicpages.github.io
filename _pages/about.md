About Me
======

This webpage is still under construction. Come back later!

I am a Ph.D. student of [Computer Science](http://www.csail.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/), where I am a member of the [Geometric Data Processing (GDP)](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) Group, advised by Prof. Justin Solomon. 

I received my B.Eng. from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/then/index.html) and M.S. from [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/). 

My research interests include geometric, graphical, probabilistic and computational problems arising in computer graphics and vision, convex optimization and statistical machine learning. I am currently working on spectral and operator approaches to these problems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in mathematical foundations of algorithms used in computer and computational sciences, with applications to real-world computing problems.
