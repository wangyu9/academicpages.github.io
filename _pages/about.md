This is the webpage of [Yu Wang](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

About Me
======

This webpage is still under construction. Come back later!

I am a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at MIT, where I am a member of the Geometric Data Processing (GDP) Group. 

I received my B.Eng. from Tsinghua University and M.S. from University of Pennsylvania. 

My research interests include geometric, graphical, probabilistic and computational problems arising in computer graphics and vision, convex optimization and statistical machine learning. I am currently working on spectral and operator approaches to these problems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in mathematical foundations of algorithms used in computer and computational sciences, with applications to real-world computing problems.
