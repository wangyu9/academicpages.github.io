**About Me**

This webpage is still under construction. 

I am a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at MIT, where I am a member of the Geometric Data Processing (GDP) Group. 

I received my B.Eng. from Tsinghua University and M.S. from University of Pennsylvania. 

My research interests include geometric, graphical, probabilistic and computational problems arising in computer graphics and vision, convex optimization and statistical machine learning. I am currently working on spectral and operator approaches to these problems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in mathematical foundations of algorithms used in computer and computational sciences, with applications to real-world computing problems.
